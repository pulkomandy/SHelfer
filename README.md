SHelfer
=======

A shelf for testing your BeAPI replicants.

Introduction
------------

After crashing Tracker more than five times in a row, I decided that it's much
easier to code if your desktop and windows stays alive. Thus "shelfer" was born.

Usage
-----

Run it. Drag your view into the window by using your view's BDragger handle. If
everything goes right, it will show up there. If you don't believe me, test it
with the Clock application ;-)

Note that shelfer won't save its content so don't worry that a messy replicant
shows up next time you start shelfer.

NOTE: due to some caching and buffering and other nasty stuff, you better close
and restart shelfer each time you have tested your app. Just to be sure you
really get to see the final version of your replicant. I once debugged the damn
app for some time just to find out that the replicant was of an older version of
the app :-(

Background Information
----------------------

The name? Basically it's just a combination of BShelf and Helfer which is German
for helper. No big deal.

Programmed June 17th 2004, after midnight until 2 o'clock.
